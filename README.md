SQLRite - Design Discussions
===
This repo was created to coordinate our shared efforts, maintain interesting discussions towards the development of `SQLRite`

`SQLRite` , is a simple embedded database developed with `Rust`. The goal is to go where no man has gone before.

### Contributing
**Inputs and ideas are warmly welcome!!!**

For initial discussions, please [open a discussion](https://github.com/sqlrite/design/discussions) first and let's talk about it. We are all ears!

If you'd like to contribute to existing discustion, **don't be shy**. Just choose a topic being discussed and let it out.

For final decisions, we plan to [open an issue](https://github.com/sqlrite/design/issues/new) and generate RFC's documents and possibly Diagram which will be stored on this repo for future reference.
